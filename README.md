# Cronitor Ping API Client

Cronitor is a service for heartbeat-style monitoring of anything that can send an HTTP request. It's particularly well suited for monitoring cron jobs, Jenkins jobs, or any other scheduled task.

This java library provides a simple abstraction for the pinging of a Cronitor monitor. For a better understanding of the API this library talks to, please see our [Telemetry API docs](https://cronitor.io/docs/telemetry-api).

## Install
You can download the cronitor client JAR from the Maven central repository.
[https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/cronitor/client/1.4.0/](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/cronitor/client/1.4.0/)

### Install with Maven
If you are using Maven, simply add this line in your pom.xml file :
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cronitor</groupId>
    <artifactId>client</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Usage with Spring

Declare a new bean in your Spring configuration :
```
<bean id="cronitorClient" class="io.cronitor.client.CronitorClient">
     <constructor-arg index="0" value="apiKey"/>
     <constructor-arg index="1" value="myEnv"/>
</bean>
```

Then simply inject this bean into the class containing the routine to monitor :
```
@Resource
private CronitorClient cronitorClient;
```

### Usage without Spring
Simply declare a new CronitorClient instance in the class containing the routine to monitor:
```
CronitorClient cronitorClient = new CronitorClient('yourApiKey','myEnv');
```

### Examples

### send a run event (a job/process has started)
```java
    cronitorClient.run("nightlyDataExport");
```

### send a complete event (a job/process has completed successfully)
```java
    cronitorClient.complete("nightlyDataExport");
```

### send a failure event (a job/process crashed)
```java
    cronitorClient.complete("nightlyDataExport");
```

### send a metrics event
```java
    Map<String, Integer> metrics = new HashMap<String, Integer>() {
            {
                put("count", 100);
                put("error_count", 5);
            }
        };
    cronitorClient.metrics("nightlyDataExport", metrics);
```

### pause a monitor
```java
    cronitorClient.pause("nightlyDataExport", numberOfHours);
```

### unpause a monitor
```java
    cronitorClient.unpause("nightlyDataExport");
```

### including messages
```java
    // each event method supports an optional message param
    cronitorClient.run("nightlyDataExport", "Started by user 123");

    cronitorClient.fail("nightlyDataExport", e.printStackTrace());
```
